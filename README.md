# stacked-regressor-housing-kaggle
My 3rd competition on kaggle, using Stacked Regressor on housing data.  

Includes the following - 
1. Imputing missing values
2. Transforming some numerical variables that seem really categorical
3. Label Encoding
4. Box Cox Transformation of skewed features (instead of log-transformation)
5. Getting dummy variables for categorical features
6. Exploring advanced linear regression techniques like - LASSO Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Kernel Ridge Regression,      Gradient Boosting Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM
7. Simple stacking of regressors - taking average
8. Advanced stacking using meta model
